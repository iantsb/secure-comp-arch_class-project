\section{Introduction}
This project aims to research and design an asymmetric encryption method targeting a processor and AI accelerator pair. In the 
theorized application, the accelerator is taken as a trusted base holding the IP of a neural network. It is therefore desired to
have an encryption scheme between CPU and accelerator to prevent malicious actors from performing snooping attacks on the bus connecting
the accelerator and processor. This project specifically considers accelerators utilizing non-volatile memory to perform compute 
in-memory operations. These types of devices have been demonstrated to allow for information to be encoded in physical device 
properties, without being stored in the current state of the cell. In the proposed encryption mechanism, values encoded 
in the memory cells are used to generate a private/public key pair, used to encrypt processor/accelerator communication.

\section{Relevant Background}
This literature review focuses on literature regarding the relevant NVM devices/device properties, asymmetric encryption, PUF-based key
generation, fault injection defense
